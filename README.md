# Bubble-Sort-Time-Complexities

* PA 1
* CPTS 223

> For this project, we will be empirically evaluating bubble sort and comparing it to our own BigO
analysis. To do this, we will use a range of input values and time how long it takes bubblesort to finish
the sorting of N random values. These timings will be plotted on a Cartesian Coordinate grid to
compare with our expected algorithm behavior. We will also test bubblesort on best and worst case
inputs to see how it runs.
