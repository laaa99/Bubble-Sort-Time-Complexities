# Bubble-Sort-Time-Complexities

* PA 1
* CPTS 223

> For this project, we will be empirically evaluating bubble sort and comparing it to our own BigO
analysis. To do this, we will use a range of input values and time how long it takes bubblesort to finish
the sorting of N random values. These timings will be plotted on a Cartesian Coordinate grid to
compare with our expected algorithm behavior. We will also test bubblesort on best and worst case
inputs to see how it runs.

# Deliverables #

>You must upload your program through Blackboard no later than midnight on Friday, September 23, 2016. The program will be uploaded as a zip file containing:

+ C++ source code
+ The chart as and image (OptimalWorstAverageCasePlot.png)
+ The CSV file your program output (BSStats.csv)

# Grading Criteria #
> Your assignment will be judged by the following criteria:
+ [70] Code operational success. Your code compiles, executes, and generates the CSV files.
+ [10] Your code is well documented and generally easy to read.
+ [10] Your program intelligently uses classes when appropriate and generally conforms to good
OOP design (i.e. everything isn't slapped into main).
+ [10] The CSV and chart in the correct format, with labeled axes, title, and legend (as
appropriate)
